Repository containing Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU CS-250 course

Repository Overview:
Welcome to my repository for the CS 250 course at Southern New Hampshire University. This repository hosts the Sprint Review and Retrospective document from my final project, which illustrates the application of Agile and Scrum practices.

Contents of This Repository:
Sprint Review and Retrospective Document: This document provides a comprehensive overview of how our team implemented Agile and Scrum methodologies throughout the project lifecycle.

Reflections on Core Concepts in Computer Science:
Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:
Understanding user needs is critical in software development. By creating user stories, we can translate vague requirements into actionable tasks. This process ensures that the development efforts are aligned with user expectations, making the final product more effective and user-centric.

My Approach to Developing Programs:
My approach to program development is deeply influenced by Agile methodologies. The flexibility of Agile practices, such as iterative development and responsive planning, allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to change. I plan to further integrate these practices in future projects to enhance efficiency and collaboration.

Being an Effective Team Member in Software Developmen:
Being a good team member in software development means more than just contributing code. It involves active participation in planning, transparent communication, and a willingness to adapt based on team needs. My experience has taught me the importance of these qualities for maintaining a productive team environment.

Conclusion:
I hope this repository provides insight into my application of Agile and Scrum methodologies in software development.
